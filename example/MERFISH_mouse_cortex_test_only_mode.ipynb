    "Our model training leverages [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/docs/intro/), a framework designed for elegantly configuring complex applications. By default, all models are saved within the `./outputs` directory, which resides at the same directory level as the LUNA codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each trained model is stored in a directory named after the date and time the job was initiated, following the format `/{date-of-job}/{time-stamp}-{general.name}`. Here, `{time-stamp}` refers to the start time of the job, and `{general.name}` corresponds to the job's name specified in the configuration file. For example, the `name` flag under the `general` section in `/LUNA/configs/experiment/MERFISH_mouse_cortex.yaml` determines this naming convention.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you locate the appropriate directory containing your completed job's details, you will find everything related to that run, including the complete configuration settings and the saved checkpoints."
